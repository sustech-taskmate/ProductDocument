## Background

Sakai is a popular system which is set up in 2005 March. Many colleges, business organizations and individual developers are taking part in this project.
Up till now, more than 300 colleges are using Sakai in their daily work. However, due to the unstable network and inconvenient interface, 
many students and teachers hope a more useful and convenient system for their study and work.

## Project Scope

We hope to develop a desktop application which can be installed
on different operating systems. We hope our users can use their CAS accounts to log in our project.

With the authentication of SUSTech, different user can get their own authority:
- For students, they can submit their assignments in the system.
- For teachers and teacher assistants, they can grade students' assignments online, get the statistical results and chat with other teachers.

## Target Users

Teachers, TAs and students of SUSTech.
