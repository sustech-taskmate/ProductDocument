## Background

The sakai system of SUSTech is not very convenient for TAs and
teachers to grade assignments. We develop this project to help
TAs and teachers to have a more convenient grading environment.

## Project Target

We want to develop a desktop application that can be deployed
on different operating systems. If users are students, they
can submit assignments, and check the score. If users are TAs
or teachers, they can grade assignments and discuss them.
We expect students have a clear vision of assignments and scores.
And graders can conveniently preview the attachments of assignment
online rather than download to localhost or download in batches,
get the relevant statistics and feedback information of specific
assignment.

## Target Users

Teachers, TAs and students of SUSTech.

## Project Scope

The functions of our project includes CAS login certification
submit assignments, send arguments, check scores, grade assignments
with notes on questions and individual items, discuss assignments,
preview attachments, get the relevant statistics and so on.
